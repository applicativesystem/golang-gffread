# a golang-gffread

- a complete gff package written in golang instead of C++. 
- a complete rewrite of the John Hopkins gffread. 
- for plants, microbial and fungal genomes as long as the annotations are matching the example files. 
- faster rates, asynchronous. 
- The C publication is here : [DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.23297.1](http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.23297.1)
- no compilation required and sample files in the sample directory.
